# TicTacToe-Bot
I made a tic tac toe bot that can always win or draw against every move. <br>
It was for a competition agaist two friends, who can make the best tic tac toe bot. <br>
It was a anticlimx because our bots do both the best move possible, so It becomes always a draw

# minimax algorithm
For this project I use the minimax algorithm. <br>
It's a very powerfull algorithm that searches in depth. <br>
It evaluate every move and calculate the best move the other player can do back. <br>
It checkes every possible combination from his position until it finds a lose, win or draw. <br>

Don't waste your time trying to win., because you can't win!
